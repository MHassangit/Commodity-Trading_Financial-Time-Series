# Commodity Trading - Analysis of Financial Time Series Code

## Overview
The code implements a sophisticated financial analysis system focused on the relationship between oil prices (Brent crude) and the Norwegian Krone (NOK) exchange rate. The analysis combines statistical modeling, time series analysis, and trading strategy development.

## Key Components and Methodologies

### 1. Data Processing and Initial Analysis
The code begins by importing necessary libraries and loading data containing:
- NOK exchange rates
- Brent crude oil prices
- Other relevant economic indicators (GDP, interest rates)
- Various currency pairs (USD, EUR, GBP)

### 2. Correlation Analysis
The code implements a novel "Correlation Catcher" methodology using weighted rolling correlations. The mathematical formula can be expressed as:

```
Weighted Correlation = Σ(w_i * Corr(MA(X,i), MA(Y,i)))
```
where:
- MA(X,i) is the moving average of variable X with window i
- w_i are logarithmically scaled weights
- Corr represents the rolling correlation

### 3. Statistical Modeling
The code employs several statistical techniques:

a) Elastic Net Regression:
- Combines L1 and L2 regularization
- Model: min_β { ||y - Xβ||² + λ₁||β||₁ + λ₂||β||₂² }
- Used to handle multicollinearity in the data

b) Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test for stationarity:
- Tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present
- Critical for time series analysis to ensure valid statistical inference

### 4. Trading Strategy Implementation

The code implements a mean-reversion trading strategy with the following components:

1. Signal Generation:
```
if price > fitted_value + 2*sigma: generate SHORT signal
if price < fitted_value - 2*sigma: generate LONG signal
```

2. Position Management:
- Implements stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Uses dynamic thresholds based on statistical measures
- Position sizing based on portfolio value

3. Performance Metrics:
- Calculates returns and risk metrics
- Implements portfolio tracking with cash and position management

### 5. Risk Management Framework

The code incorporates several risk management features:

1. Position Sizing:
- Dynamic position sizing based on account equity
- Risk limits per trade

2. Stop Loss Mechanisms:
- Statistical-based stops (2-sigma rule)
- Time-based stops (holding period limits)
- Monetary stops (maximum loss limits)

## Mathematical Formulations

### Key Statistical Measures

1. Rolling Correlation:
```
ρ(t) = Cov(X,Y) / (σx * σy)
```
where σx and σy are rolling standard deviations

2. Confidence Intervals:
```
CI = μ ± z * (σ/√n)
```
where:
- μ is the mean
- z is the z-score for desired confidence level
- σ is the standard deviation
- n is the sample size

### Trading Signals

The signal generation process uses the following logic:

```python
Signal = {
  1  if price < (forecast - 2*sigma)  # Long
  -1 if price > (forecast + 2*sigma)  # Short
  0  otherwise                        # No position
}
```

## Key Innovations

1. Weighted Correlation System:
- Uses exponentially weighted correlations
- Captures both short and long-term relationships
- Adapts to changing market conditions

2. Dynamic Model Validation:
- Continuous R-squared monitoring
- Adaptive parameter adjustment
- Rolling window optimization

3. Risk Management:
- Multi-level stop system
- Position size optimization
- Portfolio-level risk controls

## Performance Analysis

The code includes comprehensive performance analysis tools:

1. Return Metrics:
- Total return
- Risk-adjusted return
- Maximum drawdown

2. Risk Metrics:
- Volatility
- Sharpe ratio
- Value at Risk (VaR)

3. Visualization:
- Price and signal charts
- Performance heat maps
- Distribution analysis

## Limitations and Considerations

1. Market Assumptions:
- Assumes mean-reversion behavior
- Requires liquid markets for execution
- Sensitive to transaction costs

2. Model Risks:
- Parameter sensitivity
- Overfitting potential
- Regime change risks

3. Implementation Challenges:
- Execution lag effects
- Market impact considerations
- System reliability requirements

## Conclusion

This code represents a comprehensive trading system that combines sophisticated statistical analysis with practical trading implementation. It demonstrates good software engineering practices with modular design and extensive error handling, while incorporating advanced financial concepts and risk management principles.

The system's strength lies in its combination of statistical rigor with practical trading considerations, though its success would depend heavily on market conditions and careful parameter tuning. The extensive use of visualization and performance analytics provides good tools for system monitoring and optimization.
